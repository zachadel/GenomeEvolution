EXTERNAL RESOURCES:
	-variable name:
		*all lowercase
		*no special characters, only alpha numeric
	-groups:
		*all lowercase
		*groups are determined entirely by internal resources i.e. if the
			internal resources are given by ["carbs", "fats", "proteins"], then
			if there are three different types of each resource group, then the
			groups for carbs would be ["carbs_a", "carbs_b", "carbs_c"]
	-tile image name:
		*must end in .png
		*can be the same as the variable name or not
	-icon name:
		*must end in .png
		*must be the same as the tile image name but with the "_icon" inserted
			before ".png"

INTERNAL RESOURCES: (changed in favor of just using external resources internally)
	-variable name:
		*all lowercase and plural
		*resource type must be all one word i.e. "carbs"
		*the tier of the resource must come after the resource type
		*separating the tier and the resource should be a separator like "_"
		*this separator is by default "_", must be edited if changed
	-pretty name:
		*Prefix for tier 0: "Simple"
		*Prefix for tier 1: "Complex"
		*Prefix for tier n: To be determined as necessary
		*Converted group name: singular
	-icon name:
		*resource name ("carbs_0") followed by "_icon.png"

ENERGY:
	-variable name:
		*"energy"
	-icon name:
		*"energy_icon.png"

CELLS:
	-name of the cell is the name of the parts associated with it
	-each cell has parts:
		*vesicles - storage
		*nucleus - DNA
		*mitochondria - energy
		*ribosomes - unknown function
		*[part] - [function]
	-the texture for each part is stored as [name]_[part].svg
		*standard location: "res://Assets/Images/Cells/[part]/"
		*each part has its own subfolder in Cells which is lowercase and singular
			such as "nucleus" or "body" or "vesicle"
		*textures can be reused by specifying them in the cells.cfg file where 
			each cell has image locations for each body part
		*if any of them are blank, then the system assumes the standard location
	-the main cell body is stored as "res://Assets/Images/Cells/body/body_[cell name].svg"
