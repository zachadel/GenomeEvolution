Note: ALL floats must contain values to the left of the period (e.g. 0.2 instead of .2)

The roll array describes the chances for each jump outcome, i.e.
0: silent
1: excise
2: jump
3: copy

The chances will automatically be normalized, so you can write them in whatever format you find intuitive. You can stop as early as you like; the program will fill in 0s until the array is large enough. If the array is empty, it will default to a 100% chance of the "silent" outcome.
For example, each of the following arrays represent equal chances for each jump outcome:
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[3, 3, 3, 3]
[0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]
[x, x, x, x]

and a 100% chance for outcome 2 would be
[0, 0, 1] (or [0, 0, x])

and a 50% chance for outcome 1 and 50% chance for outcome 3 would be
[0, 0.5, 0, 0.5] (or [0, x, 0, x])

and a 100% chance for outcome 0 would be
[]


The keys of the range dicts are floats that describe probability in a different way; the chances accumulate.
Note that 0 is not quite 0%, but 1 is 100% (so explicit 1s are necessary; there is no use in defining a range with 0% chance anyway)
Each element of the range dicts is another dict describing that movement, as described below
For example, this range has 3 different jumping behaviors with equal chance of use:
range={
0.333: {"other_cmsm": false, "max_dist": 1},
0.666: {"other_cmsm": false, "max_dist": 10},
1: {"other_cmsm": true, "this_cmsm": false}
}

The movement dicts have the following default properties
(Note that you do not need to explicitly state every property if you want to use the default values, e.g. you only have to put "this_cmsm" if you want it to be false)
X:{
"this_cmsm": true, #Can jump to another spot on this chromosome
"other_cmsm": true, #Can jump to a spot on the other chromosome
"min_dist": 1, #If this_cmsm is true, this is the smallest distance it will move; if the chromosome is too short, it will move until it runs out of space. This really shouldn't ever be lower than 1
"max_dist": -1, #If this_cmsm is true, this is the largest distance it will move; -1 means the whole chromosome
"min_range": 0.0, #If other_cmsm is true, this is the leftmost spot as a percentage it will jump to
"max_range": 1.0, #If other_cmsm is true, this is the rightmost spot as a percentage it will jump to
"split_chance": 0.03, #The chance this will split a gene upon arrival
"impact": 0.0, #The chance that a gene at the landing site gets damaged
"gene_copy": 0.0, #The chance that a random gene is duplicated in the genome
}

You can define two different range dicts for jumping and copying, or just one range dict for both
j_range = {} # If defined, the ATE will use this range dict when jumping
c_range = {} # If defined, the ATE will use this range dict when copying
range = {} # If jumping and j_range is not defined, use this; if copying and c_range is not defined, use this
If the range that an ATE looks for isn't defined, it resorts to using the default values

By having a bunch of different movements with specific behavior, we can easily define some complicated movement behavior.

The format for a new ATE family is as follows:
[codename] # The codename is a short, descriptive name. It can really be any value at all, as long as it is unique

title="Family Name" # The name that shows up in the game
roll=[] # Described above
range={} # Described above
bunched=false # If several of this TE are adjacent, they behave as one
carry=0.0 # The chance that an adjacent gene is carried with the behavior
